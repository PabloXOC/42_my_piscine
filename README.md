# My 42 Piscine - 42 Fundación Telefónica

This repository contains the work completed during my participation in the **Piscine** at **42 Fundación Telefónica**. The Piscine is an intensive month-long coding bootcamp that focuses on building strong programming fundamentals through a series of challenging exercises and projects. It is designed to push participants to develop a deep understanding of C programming, algorithms, memory management, and problem-solving skills.

## Overview

### 1. **Basic C Programming**
   The foundational exercises focused on understanding the syntax and structure of the C language. These exercises included:
   - Implementing basic functions such as input/output handling, simple arithmetic, and string manipulation.
   - Using loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if`, `else`) to control the flow of a program.
   - Understanding variable types, arrays, and basic control structures.

### 2. **Memory Management**
   C programming requires manual memory management, and many exercises focused on:
   - Using `malloc()` and `free()` to allocate and deallocate memory.
   - Understanding the risks of memory leaks and how to avoid them.
   - Working with pointers to manipulate data structures efficiently and effectively.

### 3. **File Handling**
   Many tasks involved reading from and writing to files, which helped me understand:
   - How to open, read, write, and close files using system calls.
   - Working with file descriptors and handling errors related to file operations.
   - Implementing simple programs to parse and manipulate file content.

### 4. **Algorithms and Data Structures**
   A significant portion of the Piscine involved implementing and using common algorithms and data structures, such as:
   - **Sorting algorithms** (Bubble sort, Merge sort, etc.)
   - **Searching algorithms** (Linear search, Binary search)
   - **Recursion**: Solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
   - **Data structures** like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
   - Writing programs to manipulate these structures, including insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

### 5. **Debugging and Error Handling**
   Debugging is a critical skill in programming, and I worked extensively on:
   - Using `gdb` (GNU Debugger) to step through code and identify issues.
   - Learning how to use `valgrind` for memory leak detection.
   - Understanding and handling errors using proper return codes, `errno`, and `perror()` for better reliability.

### 6. **Working with Pointers and Structures**
   A large portion of the exercises involved working with pointers, such as:
   - Passing pointers to functions to modify data in place.
   - Dynamically allocating and freeing memory for structures and arrays.
   - Understanding pointer arithmetic and how it is used to navigate memory in complex data structures.

### 7. **Project Development and Code Quality**
   While the focus was on solving problems, I also learned how to:
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
   - Collaborate with peers by reviewing code and sharing feedback.
   - Apply coding standards and best practices (e.g., meaningful variable names, clear function structures).

### 8. **Bash Scripting**
   Alongside C programming, I also learned the basics of **Bash scripting** to automate common tasks and interact with the operating system. Some key topics I covered include:
   - Writing simple Bash scripts to perform tasks like file manipulation, system operations, and automating repetitive tasks.
   - Using common Bash commands and utilities to manipulate files, process input/output, and handle system processes.

## Skills Acquired

- **Proficiency in C Programming**: Gained hands-on experience with C's core concepts, such as variables, functions, arrays, pointers, and structs.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Learned how to dynamically allocate memory, avoid memory leaks, and work with pointers.
- **File I/O Operations**: Gained an understanding of reading from and writing to files, as well as using system calls to handle file descriptors.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implemented and optimized common data structures (like linked lists) and algorithms (like sorting and searching).
- **Debugging and Performance Tuning**: Learned how to debug C code using `gdb` and optimize algorithms for better performance.
- **Collaboration and Code Review**: Worked in a collaborative environment, improving my ability to review code and incorporate feedback.
- **Bash Scripting**: Acquired foundational knowledge of Bash scripting for automating tasks and interacting with the operating system.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile and run any of the exercises or projects, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/piscine-42-ft-repo.git
   cd piscine-42-ft-repo
   ```

2. **Compile the project**:
   Each exercise or project can be compiled using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o exercise_name exercise_name.c
   ```

3. **Run the program**:
   After compiling, run the program using:
   ```bash
   ./exercise_name
   ```
